Rabbits vs cats

Population :
- rabbits : 4 genes
  - Velocity
  - Ear
  - Smell
  - Strategy (whether this rabbit prefers to run or fake death)
- cats : 4 genes
  - Velocity
  - Sense (of smell)
  - Noise
  - Strategy (whether they are silent or running when they are chasing)

Fitness

- cats are trying to eat rabbits
- cats are walking by default
- when they see a rabbit they attack depending on the strategy
- if cats run, they make more noise
- rabbits can ear cats depending on their noise
- rabbits can fake death or run if they detect a cat
- 

Reproduction 
- done randomly between 2 individuals
- child gets randomly the genes from parents
